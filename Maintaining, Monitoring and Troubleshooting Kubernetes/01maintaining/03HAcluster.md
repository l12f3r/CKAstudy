# Maintaining Kubernetes Clusters

## High Availability cluster overview
- Applications must be online at all times by ensuring the availability of the following resources:
    - API Server
        - Stateless; multiple API Servers can run across many nodes, load balancing techniques can be applied to distribute workload
    - Cluster data store (etcd)
        - Several etcd nodes can be clustered together (**etcd cluster**) 
        - Own internal elections for replication and leader (quorum)
            - etcd requires at least two online nodes, to establish consensus; no consensus, no etcd
    - Control Plane üß† nodes
        - Multiple nodes can be executed to protect such services
- Infrastructure must also be redundant and fault-tolerant: use multiple availability zones or regions (on a cloud scenario)

### Topology - stacked etcd cluster with three Control Plane üß† nodes
- One node 1Ô∏è‚É£ works with its API Server pointing to the local etcd Pod
    - Remaining Pods (Controller Manager, Scheduler) work normally
- A second node 2Ô∏è‚É£ works with its API Server pointing to the local etcd Pod as well, but this etcd handles replicating its data between the multiple etcds Pods from other nodes
    - Remaining Pods (Controller Manager, Scheduler) work on a standby mode: they use a lease mechanism to ensure only one Scheduler and Controller Manager are running on the cluster and become online if something breaks
- The third node 3Ô∏è‚É£ works similarly to the second, backing it up
- A load balancer is set outside of the cluster to manage it, absorbing operations from kubectl and Worker üë©‚Äçüè≠ nodes' API calls
- The load balancer distributes workload to the underlying API Servers

### Topology - external etcd with three Control Plane üß† nodes
- etcd is separated from the Control Plane üß† node - it runs in an external etcd cluster, with at least three nodes (for quorum and consensus rules)
- The API Server on one 1Ô∏è‚É£ of the Control Plane üß† nodes point to the etcd cluster; remaining Pods work as usual
- The next nodes (2Ô∏è‚É£ and 3Ô∏è‚É£) will also have an API Server pointing to the etcd cluster, with standby Scheduler and Controller Manager
- To access the API services, a load balancer is used
