# CKAstudy

- Personal notes for the CKA certificate
- All content is created by me but I take no responsibility on its use by third-parties
- Might be a decent starting point for someone interested in learning Kubernetes
- Based on [Pluralsight's CKA learning path](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/certificate/certified-kubernetes-administrator)
