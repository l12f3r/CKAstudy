# Working with your Kubernetes Cluster

## kubectl introduction, usage and closer look

- Primary CLI tool for controlling workloads on a Kubernetes cluster
    - To perform **operations** (create, read, update or delete by interacting with the [API server](02kubernetesAPI.MD)) against
    - **resources** (objects like [Pods](03APIObjectsPods.MD), [Deployments](04APIObjectsControllers.MD#types-of-controllers), [Services](05APIObjectsServices.md) etc)
- Generates output on different formats (JSON, YAML)

## Main operations using kubectl
- `kubectl apply` or `kubectl create`: sends API request to create a Deployment resource
- `kubectl run`: starts a single Pod from an image (when Pod is not managed by a [controller](04APIObjectsControllers.MD))
- `kubectl explain`: provides documentation on resources, lists required fields (`apiVersion`, `kind`, `spec` etc) for declaring resource
- `kubectl delete`: deletes resources
- `kubectl get`: lists resources, provides basic information about specified resource type
- `kubectl describe`: provides detailed resource information such as Labels, Taints, Conditions, Addresses, System Info, Non-terminated Pods and Events
- `kubectl exec`: execute a command on a container
- `kubectl logs`: obtain logs from a container's stdout
- `kubectl cluster-info`: lists/inspects cluster on current context (where the Control Plane ðŸ§  is running and KubeDNS information)
- `kubectl api-resources`: asks for known resources and lists its aliases (`SHORTNAMES`)
- `kubectl -h`: help page - can be combined with operations (`kubectl get -h` for example)

## Specifying the output format
- `-o wide`:  output additional info on deployed resources
- `yaml`: outputs content as YAML formatted API object
- `json`: outputs content as JSON formatted API object
- `dry-run`: prints the object but no further action is taken; for test reasons

## How a kubectl command should be
`kubectl [command] [type] [name] [flags]` is the example pattern herein used. Some examples of valid commands:
- `kubectl get pods podExample --output=yaml` would output information from the `podExample` Pod as YAML. If only `kubectl get pods` was entered, information on all Pods within the default namespace would be provided;
- `kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx` would create a deployment using the `nginx` image.
