# Kubernetes networking fundamentals

### Introducing the Kubernetes networking model
- Basic communication rules:
    - **All Pods can communicate with each other on all nodes**
        - Anywhere in the cluster, regardless of underlying topology
    - **Agents on a node can communicate with all Pods on that node**
        - Agents = software (like the kubelet or kube-proxy, that need to contact the Pods that they need to orchestrate)
    - **No Network Address Translation (NAT)** ðŸš«ðŸ›œ
        - Pods need to communicate with each other (regardless of the node) using its real IP address

## Kubernetes network topology
- **Node network**:
    - Cloud/database network, where the cluster's nodes are connected to (AWS VPC, for instance)
    - Each node has an IP address assigned from this network, and nodes can reach each other (apart from reaching other resources within this network)
- **Pod network**:
    - Each Pod has a single IP address assigned, either from the node network or (more commonly) from a pool of IPs called **Pod CIDR range**
- **Cluster network**
    - Used by services using the `clusterIP` Service type
    - IP addresses for Services on this network are allocated from the range specified on its range parameter

## Pod networking and communication
1. Inside a multi-containered Pod:
    _ Containers within it share the same network namespace (implemented by the **Pause/Infrastructure container**), a single IP address and port range for applications to run on
        - The Pause/Infrastructure container starts before the creation/start of a Pod, setting up the network namespace for the containers to share
            - It also enables application containers to be restarted without interrupting the network namespace
            - Has the same lifecycle as the Pod (if Pod is deleted, so is the Pause/Infrastructure container)
    - Communication is held over `localhost`
2. Communication between Pods within the same node:
    - Held by an interface inside each Pod (`eth0`, `veth0`), that is attached to a local software bridge/tunnel interface, to communicate using their actual Pod's IP addresses
3. Communication between Pods from different nodes:
    - Held by using Pod's real IP addresses
    - Network between those nodes must use a Layer 2/3 (link/network) or overlay (virtual network over network) connectivity
4. kube-proxy implements access to Services by exposing them to both internal and external cluster users (depending upon the Service type)

## Container Network Interface (CNI)
- Implements container and Pod networking in a cluster on an abstracted manner
- Defines a **standardized specification** for managing container networking, used across other container orchestration platforms as well
    - It interacts with the container runtime interface, taking responsibility over operations such as setting up namespaces, interfaces, bridge/tunnel configurations and IP addressing
- Kubernetes uses **CNI plugins** to implement its networking model (like Calico or Cilium, for instance)
    - Such plugins are usually deployed as Pods controlled by Daemonsets running on each node
    - Some features brought by plugins could be management, application of network policies (like QoS), encryption, traffic segmentation etc
- kubelets on nodes are also responsible for controlling local network configuration, which in turn defines a **network plugin** (either CNI or Kubenet)
    - When configured for CNI, the kubelet loads its plugin and configuration
    - If set for Kubenet, the node is configured with routes and bridges inside the BaseOS
